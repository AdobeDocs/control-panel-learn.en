# Add SSL certificates

Adobe Campaign [!UICONTROL Control Panel] allows you to add SSL certificates to secure your subdomains.

## Accessing Control Panel Subdomain Management

To access the Subdomain Management in Control Panel, go to:

* [Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/#/home) > Solution picker: **[!DNL Campaign]** > **[!UICONTROL Control Panel]** card > **[!UICONTROL Subdomains & Certificates]** card
  
  or
* Directly from the URL: [https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain](https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain)

## Steps to add SSL certificates

Adding SSL certificates requires three steps:

### 1. Generate Certificate Signing Requests

The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is required for the purchase of an SSL certificate. It must be generated for the instance and the subdomains you are planning to secure.
