# Allowlist IP addresses

The Control Panel allows you to set up new connections to your instances by allow listing IP address ranges. By default, an Adobe Campaign instance is not accessible from various IP addresses. Therefore, an IP address must be allowlisted:

* To allow access to the [!DNL Campaign] instance from this IP address
* To connect an API to your Message Center or marketing instance

## Accessing Control Panel Instance Settings

To access the Subdomain Management in Control Panel, go to:

* [Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/#/home) > Solution picker: **[!DNL Campaign]** > **[!UICONTROL Control Panel]** card > **Instances Settings** card 
  or
* Directly from the URL: [https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/instances](https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/instances)
